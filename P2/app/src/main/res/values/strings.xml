    <string name="about_text">Stasis is an anxiety self-assessment application. In providing users with insight into their anxiety levels, we hope to assist them into taking the necessary actions to improving their mental health.
        The application is based on a 22 questions questionnaire developed by psychologist Adrian Wells. The results of the test are divided into three categories and meant to give the user a complex insight into three of the most common forms of anxieties the user might be experiencing.
